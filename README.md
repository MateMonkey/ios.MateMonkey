# MateMonkey
An iOS app to find mate dealers around you!

##Description##
This app provides a native iOS environment for the website [MateMonkey](www.matemonkey.com), meant to find Club Mate dealers all over the world!

##Version##

Current version: 0.1 alpha

### Development Roadmap ###

* Filters for dealers and products
* Show current stock and enable users to update
* Add dealers
* small, unobtrusive notifications (like Android's toasts) for dealer updates (successful/failed), zoomed out too far

## Issues ##
Tracked via github's bugtracker

## Why is this Open Source? ##
Because [MateMonkey](https://github.com/MateMonkey) partly is open source, too! Also, I want to improve my coding skills by coding "out in the open". Anyone can participate and help make the code and the app better by contributing.
